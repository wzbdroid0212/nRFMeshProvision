- **1.0.1**:
    - Adds minor improvements to the copy on some UI components within the application.
    - Bugfix: Performance improvement due to removing an intended 2 second delay when switching between Composition Data Get state and AppKeyAdd state due to an earlier bug.
    - Bugfix: fixed an issue with block acknowledgements that caused longer messages that needs multiple acknowledgment to fail.
    - Bugfix: fixed an issue in the GenericOnOff control view, this bug caused loss of control over the node when it's added then removed from a subscription group.

- **1.0**:
    - Adds a better approach for GenericOnOffSet messages to be sent to all subscribed addresses on the target element. If no subscriptions are present, messages will be sent to the element's unicast.
    - Adds element unicast address within the node view to allow easier configuration.
    - Adds Application Version and build numbers in the settings view.
    - Adds a more descriptive title depending on OOB type in the user input view.

    - Bugfix: Fixed a crash when the input OOB length won't fit within an UIn16 value.
    - Bugfix: Input and Output OOB actions where wrongly parsed as Octets instead of bit fields, causing a crash when a node supports more than one action type.
    - Bugfix: Fixed a bug causing Output OOB action types that are not Numeric OOB to never trigger due to a legacy check that's no longer required.

- **0.4**:
    - Adds GenericOnOffServer control.
    - Adds UI improvement in Element view, now subscription,publication and both states are shown on the cell.
    - Adds UI improvement for GenericOnOff control to disable the feature if an AppKey is not bound to the model.

    - Bugfix: Sequence number's first octet was not calculated properly, causing it to always be 0x00.
    - Bugfix: Fixed Typo in scanner view "Discovery" -> "Discover".
